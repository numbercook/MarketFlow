MAIN DATA
The critical inputs (i.e. to define the problem and not related to GUI) are obtained via a link to Access.  A table on the Database Link page shows these inputs.  Note:  Encumbered supply is not input.

CASES
Only simple cases are used in this project (i.e. all identifiers are saved, not explicit datasets)

DATASETS
In order to facilitate the creation editting of scenarios under consistent inputs (e.g. execution options) a number of datasets have been specified.  These datasets can be loaded/saved in various pages in the GUI.  For example, the Execution Options can be loaded from the Optimization Dashboard.

MU Definitions:		Contain supply information
Mill Definitions:		contain project (demand) information
Execution Options:		contain execution options, penalty weights etc.
Cost Data:		Contain haulcosts
TREES Targets		contain supply targets to simulate actual wood flow (mu to dest)
			
CASE WIZARD
From the Case Management Page, users can run the Case Creation Wizard which allows the user to load a data set from each of the above (except other defaults) and save the resulting case.
